    <h2>Play: [The Master Builder Act 1] by [Henrik Ibsen]</h2>
    <h3> SOLNESS.
        [Aloud.] What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?</h3> 
        <h3>
        KAIA. 
        [Starts.] Oh, it is only something that--</h3> 
        <h3>  
        SOLNESS. 
        Let me look at it, Miss Fosli. [Bends over her, pretends to be looking
        into the ledger, and whispers:] Kaia!</h3>
        <h3>  
        KAIA.
        [Softly, still writing.] Well?</h3>
        <h3>  
        SOLNESS.
        Why do you always take that shade off when I come?</h3>
        <h3>  
        KAIA. 
        [As before.] I look so ugly with it on.</h3>
        <h3>   
        SOLNESS.
        [Smiling.] Then you don't like to look ugly, Kaia?</h3>
        <h3> 
        KAIA.
        [Half glancing up at him.] Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.</h3>
        <h3>  
        SOLNESS.
        [Strokes her hair gently.] Poor, poor little Kaia--
        </h3>
